Consider the following database 
Student (Roll_No int, Sname varchar (20), Sclass char (10)) 
Teacher (T_No int, Tname char (20), Experience int) 
The Student and Teacher are related with many to many relationship with the descriptive 
attribute Subject. 


create table student(rollno int primary key,sname varchar(20),sclass varchar(20));

create table teacher(t_no int primary key,t_name varchar(20),Experience int);

create table st(rollno int references student,tno int references teacher,subject varchar(20));

insert into student values(101,'om','fy');
insert into student values(102,'sai','fy');
insert into student values(103,'ram','sy');

insert into teacher values(01,'mr.joshi',5);
insert into teacher values(02,'mr.navle',6);
insert into teacher values(03,'mr.joshi',7);

insert into st values(101,01,'ds');
insert into st values(102,02,'php');
insert into st values(103,01,'rdbms');

select * from student;
select * from teacher;
select * from st;


a)Write a trigger before inserting the teacher record into a teacher 
table. Experience should be a minimum of 4 years. If it is less than 4 
years trigger gets fired and displays an appropriate message.

create or replace function teach()returns trigger as
$$
declare
begin
if (new.experience<4)then 
raise exception'experience less than 4 not allowed..';
end if;
return new;
end;
$$
language plpgsql;

create trigger s1
before insert on teacher
for each row execute procedure teach();


b). Write a cursor to accept the student name from the user as an input
and give list of subjects taken by the student.


create or replace function stud(sname1 student.sname%type)returns void as
$$
declare
r1 st.subject%type;
c1 cursor for select subject from student,st where student.rollno=st.rollno and sname1=sname;
begin
open c1;
loop
fetch c1 into r1;
exit when not found;
raise notice'subject=%',r1;
end loop;
close c1;
end;
$$
language plpgsql;

c). Write a stored function to find the details of the maximum
experienced teacher.

create or replace function max1()returns int as
$$
declare
r1 teacher%rowtype;
begin
select min(experience)into r1 from teacher;
raise notice'tno=%',r1.t_no;
raise notice'tname=%',r1.t_name;
raise notice'experience=%',r1.experience;
end;
$$
language plpgsql;
